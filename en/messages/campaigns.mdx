## What are Doko campaigns?

Campaigns allow you to create and send promotional messages to specific groups of contacts using WhatsApp. With campaigns you can:

- **Segment your audience**: Choose specific contact lists for each campaign
- **Personalize messages**: Use templates with dynamic parameters to make each message unique
- **Schedule sends**: Decide when to send your messages, either immediately or at a future date
- **Track results**: View all your campaigns from your dashboard

<Tip>Campaigns are ideal for promotions, events, reminders, and personalized mass communications</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before creating your first campaign, make sure you have:

1. **Contact lists created**: You need at least one contact list to send the campaign
2. **Active WhatsApp integration**: You must have the WhatsApp Business integration configured and active
3. **Meta-approved templates**: Message templates must be pre-approved by Meta for use

<Warning>Without an active WhatsApp integration, you will not be able to create or send campaigns</Warning>
