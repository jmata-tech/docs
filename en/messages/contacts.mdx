## Why is having contacts important for your business?

Contacts are the most important part of your future interactions. When you save them in your dashboard, you can:

- Keep a record of people you or the chatbot have interacted with
- Prepare campaigns, flows and actions based on specific segments 
- Initialize proactive conversations and customize them using the contact's profile data

<Tip>Same as Conversations, having an organized base allows you to find who to contact much quicker</Tip>


## Ways to add contacts

You have a number of ways to create or save contacts on your dashboard:

1. Save from chatbot conversations: when a user shares their data, you can save them as a contact.
2. Add manually: create a contact from the Contacts section by entering name, email, country code, and phone number.
3. Import contacts (CSV): upload a file with multiple records to bulk add them.

### Tips for CSV imports

- Make sure that the columns are named correctly (name, email, phone, country_code)
- Validate emails and phone numbers before importing to minimize errors
- Handle duplicates: decide whether to update the existing contact or create a new one.

## Update and delete contacts

- Update: change contact fields like name, email, country code, or phone number when user data changes
- Delete: remove contacts that you no longer need to maintain in your database

Both actions are available from the list and on the contact detail.

## Filters and organizing the list

Organize and quickly find who you're looking for. You can filter and sort by:

- Name
- Email 
- Country code 
- Phone number
- Creation date 

These criteria help you segment and prioritize your actions, similar to how you can filter by state in Conversations.
