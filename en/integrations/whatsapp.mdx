### Prerequisites

1. Create a Meta Business Portfolio  
You need to have a Meta Business Portfolio to use the WhatsApp integration.

You can create a business portfolio at [Meta for Business](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657).

2. Get a dedicated phone number for this chatbot  
You need to get a phone number that hasn’t been used with WhatsApp Business before.

        When Facebook verifies your phone number, it will take you to the next step. To confirm that you are the business owner, it will display a QR code on screen to scan and verify, but it often throws an error when generating it.

        <Danger>
        To fix the error, you must select the "Back" option to return to the previous page and re-enter the phone number.  

        If you select the <i>"Add a new WhatsApp number"</i> bar, you can choose the profile you created to proceed to the next part of the integration.

### Live Mode
Live mode is a useful tool that allows the conversation to be transferred to a human agent.  
When activated, the bot automatically deactivates, allowing the agent to reply directly to the client’s messages.

Live chat only has two states:
- **Enabled:** any message sent to the client through WhatsApp Business will activate live mode, stopping bot responses.  
- **Disabled:** requires you to manually set up an activation phrase so that when the admin sends it, the user can communicate with a human agent for support.

### Reactivation

Set a phrase so users can automatically reactivate the chatbot from live mode.  
This phrase will disable live mode until further notice, allowing the bot to take control of the conversation again.

The message just needs to contain the configured phrase.

<Tip>
You can set up quick replies in WhatsApp Business to make it easier for users to send the exact phrase. [Learn how to set up quick replies](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/).
